# Similarity(Probability) Score Calculation Logic

### Let's take example of clarity 

sim_score_from_col_name = similarity score calculated from the column name

sim_score_from_col_val = similarity score calculated from the column name

clarity_normalizing_factor_for_col_name = weightage given to the "sim_score_from_col_name"

clarity_normalizing_factor_for_col_value = weightage given to the "sim_score_from_col_val"


Final_similarity_score = (sim_score_from_col_name * clarity_normalizing_factor_for_col_name) + 
                         (sim_score_from_col_val * clarity_normalizing_factor_for_col_value)
